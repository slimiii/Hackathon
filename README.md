This game is called self-destruct chess, the code literally destroys random HTML parts of the side when you make a move, press "Play Again", "Set Position" or "Flip Board".

The game itself is available at https://chess.slimiii.net.

It is very funny to see it just break.
If you somehow manage to beat that game, you do have a lot of luck.
